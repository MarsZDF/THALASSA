# THALASSA
THALASSA stands for Technologies for Hazard Avoidance and Landing for Autonomous Spacecraft with Situational Awareness. THALASSA is a modular prototyping environment developed during Marco Z. Di Fraia's doctorate at Cranfield University, with the general scope of developing, testing, and eventually deploying autonomous navigation technologies. The package has been developed to be able to control as many aspects as possible of the simulations.

In this first iteration, THALASSA employs two : MATLAB and Blender to simulate a camera.
